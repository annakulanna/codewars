## Task:

Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. 

Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.

## Examples:

solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]
